# my-ip
Small Python script to get user public ip  inspired by monip.org

I did this as a challenge to keep Python clear in my head and practice some new things.

What does this do?
    It fetches various network information (IP address, reverse DNS, proxy address, etc) about a connecting client and display them on a web page.

What's next?
    Next step is to create a docker image for it to be easily deployed. In the future I'm thinking to do the same thing with Kubernetes.
